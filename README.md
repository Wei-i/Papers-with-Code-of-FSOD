Few-shot Object Detection Recent Work


## Few Shot Object Detection Preliminaries
* K-shot N-way Object Detection
  - K means  the number of the objects for each class
  - N means the number of classes for few shot detection
* DataSet Split 
  - Base ClassSet $𝐶_𝑏$ , Base Dataset $𝐷_𝑏$ contains $\{(𝑥_𝑖, 𝑦_𝑖)\}$ about abundant images and annotations
  - Novel ClassSet $𝐶_𝑛$  , Novel Dataset $𝐷_𝑛$ contains $\{(𝑥_𝑖, 𝑦_𝑖)\}$ about few images and annotations


* DataSet Split 、 PASCAL VOC
